# There are three modes here(train/inference/predict). 
# 1). train mode is used to train a model for neural network. Set the mode = train
# 2). inference mode is used to show the accuracy of model by labeled data. You should do this before you have trained a model. Set the mode = inference
# 3). predict mode is used to predict the data without label. You should do this before you have trained a model.
